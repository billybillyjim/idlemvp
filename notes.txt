Tilly's minimal activities of a state are
War-making – "eliminating or neutralizing their own rivals"
State-making – "eliminating or neutralizing their rivals inside their own territory"
Protection – "eliminating or neutralizing the enemies of their clients"  These first three can be wrapped up into some kind of military system. Maybe even just manpower being leveraged by 3 sliders?
Extraction – "acquiring the means of carrying out the first three activities" - a taxation system - all goods produced can be taxed. Will need a better economic system for this.
Adjudication – "authoritative settlement of disputes among members of the population" - a law and order system A serires of toggles for what is allowed with bonuses/tradeoffs?
Distribution – "intervention in the allocation of goods among the members of the population" - some kind of welfare system 
Production – "control of the creation and transformation of goods and services produced by the population" - hire/fire workers via the law system


Buildings should supply value to a certain amount of population. High value when you have enough, low value if you overbuild or underbuild.
Production and consumption need to be simplified, right now it isn't clear how you get 1 from the other. Maybe describe it as hourly production and daily consumption?

Pretend blind playthrough notes 1:
1. Main screen is empty and should have something in it.
2. It is hard to tell what the effect of hiring or firing someone is.
3. It is hard to tell when your people are not producing enough of something.
4. If there aren't going to be numbers there needs to be some other indicator until numbers are invented. Clay bullae could supply some kind of replacement?

Notes 2.
1. Too many buildings available at the start. -- DONE
2. Lack of numbers makes all the information hard to follow -- MAYBE DONE?
3. Current hint is not prominent enough
4. too hard to tell what is going on.
5. Homelessness rate is  still a number -- DONE
6. Hide Stockpiles, Buildings, Technology, Laws, Modifiers at the start. Maybe have a tutorial menu that only includes some things to start out --DONE
7. Death causes show up wrong. -- DONE
8. Initial tech is too slow.
9. Menu order is bad -- DONE
10. Tech reqs are too loose
11. missing workers are not using formatNumber -- DONE
12. Tech alert should probably only show if there is no focustech -- DONE
13. building menu buttons can jump around as you click -- DONE
14. Hold to spam for buttons would be good. --Just make it not annoying to click
15. It needs to be clearer if you have enough food, etc. -- DONE
16. Wells need to supply more initial water, shouldn't be an issue until you have Numbers unlocked. -- DONE?
17. Use actual units somewhere until numbers are available. -- DONE
18. Clay bullae need clay but its consumed too fast. --Maybe Done
19. Hard to see progress without numbers. --Maybe Done

Ideas:
Main screen should be a shortcut for the specific tasks required in the "tutorial" up to numbers.
