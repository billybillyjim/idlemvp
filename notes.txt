Tilly's minimal activities of a state are
War-making – "eliminating or neutralizing their own rivals"
State-making – "eliminating or neutralizing their rivals inside their own territory"
Protection – "eliminating or neutralizing the enemies of their clients"  These first three can be wrapped up into some kind of military system. Maybe even just manpower being leveraged by 3 sliders?
Extraction – "acquiring the means of carrying out the first three activities" - a taxation system - all goods produced can be taxed. Will need a better economic system for this.
Adjudication – "authoritative settlement of disputes among members of the population" - a law and order system A serires of toggles for what is allowed with bonuses/tradeoffs?
Distribution – "intervention in the allocation of goods among the members of the population" - some kind of welfare system 
Production – "control of the creation and transformation of goods and services produced by the population" - hire/fire workers via the law system


Buildings should supply value to a certain amount of population. High value when you have enough, low value if you overbuild or underbuild.
Production and consumption need to be simplified, right now it isn't clear how you get 1 from the other. Maybe describe it as hourly production and daily consumption?
